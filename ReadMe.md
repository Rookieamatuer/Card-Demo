This is a personal demo

To record the learning process of implementing interface

The game interface is adaptive to different resolution

Inluding basic start interface and setting page in game

Start menu implemented the slider to control the volume of bgm, which is attached to the slider in the  in game setting page, and the level choice is also available. Also, in the intro section, implemented the scroll view, which is easy to contain more content.

The in game setting page is implemented to offer the function of music and effect sounds adjust, and the game will be paused when the setting page is open.

While in the battle, the interface of battle is also been implemented. Player can check the cards in the deck and the number they used in real time, and the pointer for enemy chosen is refer to << slay the spire >>. The animation of cards is implemented by using Dotween package.
